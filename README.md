# Financial Loans Dashboard  

## Overview  
This **Financial Loans Dashboard** provides an in-depth analysis of loan data, offering key insights into the performance of financial loan applications. By analyzing metrics such as average Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio, average interest rates, and total loan amounts, the dashboard allows stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding loan portfolios. The dashboard categorizes loans into "Good" and "Bad" loans, providing a deeper understanding of loan health.

## Features and Calculations  
- **Key Metrics**:  
  - **Average DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio)**: This metric calculates the average ratio of debt to income for all loan applicants. It provides insight into the applicant's ability to repay loans based on their income.  
  - **Average Interest Rate**: The average interest rate applied to all loans. This helps to analyze lending practices and profitability across different loan categories.  
  - **Total Loan Applications**: The total number of loan applications received. This provides an overview of the demand for loans.  
  - **Total Received Amount**: The total amount that borrowers have received from the loans.  
  - **Total Funded Amount**: The total amount of loans that have been funded and disbursed to the borrowers.  

- **Loan Grouping**:  
  - Loans are categorized into **"Good"** and **"Bad"** loans based on their performance and other criteria (such as repayment history). Separate calculations are performed for each group, allowing for comparative analysis.
  - For each loan category (Good, Bad, and Total), calculations such as average DTI, average interest rate, total loan applications, total received, and total funded amounts are made separately, providing a detailed view of each loan group.

- **Tooltips**:  
  - Tooltips are incorporated to facilitate easy navigation through different loan types (Good, Bad, and Total). By hovering over data points or metrics, users can quickly get contextual information, helping to understand the significance of each figure in relation to the overall loan data.

- **Drillthrough**:  
  - A **Drillthrough Board** has been created for each key measurement. This feature allows users to select any measurement (e.g., Average DTI, Average Interest Rate) and view a more detailed breakdown. The drillthrough provides an option to explore metrics at a granular level, offering additional data for in-depth analysis and reporting.

## Visualizations and Insights  
- **Loan Group Comparisons**:  
  - Visual comparisons between the "Good" and "Bad" loans group are provided for each key metric, highlighting differences in DTI, interest rates, and funding amounts.
  
- **Time Analysis**:  
  - The dashboard can include time-based analysis if available, showing trends in loan applications, funding, and other key metrics over specific periods (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
  
- **Loan Performance**:  
  - A separate section could visualize loan performance, using indicators such as loan default rates, funding trends, and repayment history.

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Power BI**: Power BI is used to create the interactive dashboard, featuring charts, KPIs, and slicers to visualize financial loan data.  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: DAX is utilized for custom calculations, including the grouping of loans into "Good" and "Bad" categories, as well as for calculating the average DTI, average interest rate, and other key metrics.

4. **Interpret Data**:  
   - The visualizations will update dynamically based on your interactions, providing insights into the health of loan applications and helping make decisions about future lending strategies.

5. **Time-based Analysis (if available)**:
