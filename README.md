This project is an interactive dashboard created using Power BI to analyze IMDb movie data. The dashboard offers insights into movie ratings, trends, and other key metrics through intuitive visualizations. The dataset was obtained via web scraping directly in Power BI, cleaned, and prepared for analysis.

## Features

### 1. Data Acquisition
- IMDb movie data was web-scraped directly within Power BI.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Addressed inconsistencies in the data.
- Handled missing values.
- Structured and transformed the data for efficient visualization and analysis.

### 3. DAX Calculations
- Created measures to calculate:
  - Average ratings.
  - Maximum and minimum ratings.
- Additional DAX calculations for in-depth analysis.

### 4. Interactive Dashboard
- Key metrics visualized include:
  - Average movie ratings.
  - Highest and lowest-rated movies.
  - Trends in ratings over time.
- Dynamic filters to explore data by genre, release year, and other attributes.
