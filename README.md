# HR Management Dashboard  

## Project Overview  
This project involves creating a comprehensive **HR Management Dashboard** using data spanning four years (2015–2018). The data consisted of monthly CSV files, which were consolidated and analyzed to extract meaningful insights. Pivot tables were used to generate all the metrics and visualizations tailored to specific business needs.  

## Features  
- **Data Consolidation**:  
  - Combined numerous monthly CSV files (2015–2018) into a unified dataset.  
  - Ensured data consistency and accuracy through preprocessing.  

- **Analysis and Visualizations**:  
  - Created pivot tables for each visualization to provide accurate calculations.  
  - Insights include turnover rates, employee distribution by region, hiring trends, separations, and average tenure.  

## Key Insights  
- **Employee Trends**:  
  - Active employees increased steadily from 2015 to 2018.  
  - Turnover rates and reasons for termination (voluntary/involuntary) were analyzed.  

- **Regional Insights**:  
  - Employee distribution by region showed higher activity in the Central and East regions.  
  - Gender and tenure data provided a detailed view of workforce composition.  

- **Performance Metrics**:  
  - Separation reasons (bad hires vs. others) and hiring trends were visualized for better HR planning.  

## Tools and Techniques  
- **Microsoft Excel**:  
  - Consolidation of CSV files.  
  - Use of pivot tables and charts for analysis and visualization.  
- **SQL Server**:  
  - Data loading and initial preprocessing for consistency.
